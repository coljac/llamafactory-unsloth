# Llamafactory-unsloth

Docker container with [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) and [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth).

Dependency hell. Seems to work, pull requests welcome!

Proxychains is there so this can be made to work in a cluster without internet access.
